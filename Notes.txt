A. Initializing the project

1. Backend:

a. cd into backend folder
b. run 'npm init -y' (this command will create a package.json file for the backend)
c. run 'npm install express mongoose dotenv cors bcryptjs jsonwebtoken nodemon' (this command will install the required backend dependencies)

2. Frontend:

a. npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react (this command initializes a react project using vite and creates a folder)
b. cd into frontend folder
c. run 'npm install axios react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom bootstrap' (this command will install the required frontend dependencies)

3. Configure run command

a. npm install concurrently --save-dev (make sure you are in the root folder)
b. add the following scripts to the package.json file in the root folder under 'scripts': 
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
    "server": "cd backend && nodemon server.js",
    "client": "cd frontend && npm run dev"

run npm run start to start both the backend and frontend servers.

B. Backend setup:

1. models:

    - This folder contains our Mongoose models. (structure of the data we are going to store in the database)
    - Keeps data logic isolated and reusable.

2. routes: 

    - This folder contains all the HTTP route definitions. 
    - Each file defines how to respond to specific URL paths. 

3. controllers:

    - This folder contains the functions that are ran when a route is called.
    - Basically, the logic that responds to API calls. 

4. middleware:

    - This folder contains the functions that run before our routes.
    - Often used to chekc for authentication. 

C. Random notes:

1. async (req, res) => {} is an arrow function that takes in two parameters, req and res.
    - req is the request object that holds data about the incoming HTTP request (headers, body, params).
    - res is the response object that sends data back to the client.
    - The 'async' keyword allows us to use 'await' inside the function.
    - 'await' pauses the function until a Promose (database query, API calls) finishes, making async code look synchronous and easier to manage.
